## Why worry about reproducibility?

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.48\textwidth}
\textbf{Working towards future reproducibility makes my code easier}\\ for my collaborators (and me) to read, run, and debug\\ \textbf{today},\\ and that’s why I think reproducibility is a \\ \textbf{win-win for all researchers}.”

## Why worry about reproducibility?

“[Reproducibility] provides security, saves time, and forces me to be more thoughtful about my workflow.” - Ethan Young

\begin{itemize}
\item make your life easier!
\item collaborations
\item broader research impact
\item increased citations
\item transparency
\item grant and journal requirements
\end{itemize}

## Is my research reproducible?

- Are your research documents stored in these formats?
    - .csv
    - .txt
    - .pdf
    - .html
    - .R
        - \textcolor{blue}{YES!}
        
    - .doc/.docx
    - .sas
    - .xls/.xlsx
    - any other proprietary file format
        - \textcolor{red}{NO!}
        
## Is my research reproducible?

- Are your files easily shared with others?
    - Solution: GitHub
    - Solution: Organized directory structure

- Are your files relatively linked?
    - Solution: RStudio projects

- Is your code well-documented/commented?
    - Solution: R-Markdown or R-Oxygen

- Is your code linear? 
    - Solution: Clearing environment often & not saving .Rdata
    - Solution: Each program completes one task or analysis
    - Solution: Don't rely on manual commenting/uncommenting
